This project, provided by Codecademy in partnership with the Twitch Science Team, looks at Twitch stream and chat data. I use SQL to query insights, which I then display using the Matplotlib library.

Some skills displayed in this project include:
 - using SQL queries to aggregate, group, and order data
 - work with multiple tables
 - use Matplotlib library to visualize bar, line, and pie plots

If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to let me know! Thank you for viewing!
